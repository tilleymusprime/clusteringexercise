This is the clustering exercise
The issues I am currently having:
1. I am not sure what form the data is supposed to look like.  For example, in Spectral Clustering, there is data produced but I am not sure what it means.
2. I don't really understand the blob function.  It is used to generate data in a lot of examples but I am not exactly sure what it is generating for x and y and how it gets those numbers.  This affects both the silhouette score and finding the ideal number of PCA components.
3. There are several times where I get an error code that says I need to reshape the data.  Do I need to reshape the data or does that message indicate something is wrong earlier in the script?
